# Assets Folders

These directories are ready for your assets. The folders exist but appear empty to the analyzer because they only contain .gitkeep files.

This is normal and won't affect your app's functionality. Once you add actual assets (images, animations, models), these warnings will disappear.

## Directory Structure

- **images/** - Image assets (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- **icons/** - Icon files
- **animations/** - Lottie animation files (.json)
- **models/** - TensorFlow Lite models (.tflite)
- **data/** - JSON, CSV, or other data files
